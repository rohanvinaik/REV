Precision Prompt Injection System
=================================

Uses deep behavioral insights from reference library to intelligently target
prompt injection at critical transition points in larger models.

KEY INSIGHT: The reference library tells us WHERE to look (restriction sites)
and WHAT to look for (behavioral patterns). This enables precision targeting
instead of exhaustive analysis.

Architecture:
1. Load reference topology for model family
2. Identify restriction sites and stable regions
3. Generate specialized prompts for each behavioral phase
4. Focus deep analysis ONLY on transition points
5. Skip stable regions (parallel process if needed)
