REV - Restriction Enzyme Verification

A framework for memory-bounded, black-box LLM comparison using 
restriction enzyme verification techniques combined with:

- Sequential Testing Framework with anytime-valid statistical tests
- Challenge Generation with seeded, deterministic prompts  
- Model Verification Pipeline with streaming execution
- Hyperdimensional Computing Core with 8K-100K dimensional vectors
- Hamming Distance LUTs with 16-bit lookup tables for 10-20Ã— speedup
- Privacy-Preserving Infrastructure with zero-knowledge proofs

Components adapted from PoT_Experiments and GenomeVault for REV verification.
