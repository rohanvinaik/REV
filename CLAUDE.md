# REV - Restriction Enzyme Verification System

## ðŸŽ¯ CORE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPERIMENT

**THE WHOLE POINT**: REV enables verification of massive LLMs (like Yi-34B with 68GB memory footprint) that EXCEED available device memory through intelligent segmented execution. This is NOT about avoiding loading the model - it's about making it POSSIBLE to run and verify models that wouldn't otherwise fit in memory AT ALL.

### Why This Matters
- **Problem**: Modern LLMs (70B, 175B parameters) require 140GB-350GB+ RAM
- **Solution**: REV segments execution to verify these models with only 8-16GB active RAM
- **Validation**: Yi-34B (68GB) successfully runs on 64GB system with only 2-3GB active memory per segment

### Key Innovation
REV treats transformer models like DNA sequences that can be "cut" at restriction sites (attention boundaries, layer transitions) and processed segment-by-segment while maintaining cryptographic verification of the complete computation through Merkle trees.

### What We're Testing with Yi-34B
1. **Memory-Bounded Execution**: Process 68GB model with <4GB active memory
2. **Behavioral Segmentation**: Automatically discover model's processing regions
3. **Cryptographic Integrity**: Generate Merkle proofs for all segments
4. **Semantic Fingerprinting**: Create hyperdimensional vectors for model behavior
5. **Statistical Verification**: Use SPRT for efficient model comparison

## Project Overview
REV is a comprehensive framework for memory-bounded, black-box LLM comparison using restriction enzyme verification techniques combined with hyperdimensional computing and privacy-preserving infrastructure.
