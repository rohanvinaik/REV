\#\# Abstract  
We introduce \*\*Restriction Enzyme Verification (REV)\*\*, a method for comparing large language models (LLMs) whose parameter sizes exceed available device memory. REV treats a transformer as a composition of functional segments separated by \*\*restriction sites\*\*—architecturally or behaviorally meaningful cut points. Using a pre-committed challenge set and a streamed, segment-wise execution, REV emits compact \*\*segment signatures\*\* derived from activations (or output logits in the black-box case). These signatures are committed in a \*\*Merkle tree\*\* per challenge and aggregated with an anytime-valid sequential test (PoT-style) to reach \*\*SAME / DIFFERENT / UNDECIDED\*\* conclusions under controlled error rates.

We further extend REV with a \*\*Semantic Hypervector (HDC) layer\*\* inspired by \*\*GenomeVault’s Hypervector Architecture\*\*, enabling \*\*robust, spoof-resistant behavioral sites\*\*. Prompts and model responses are embedded into very high-dimensional vectors (8K–100K dims) using binding/permutation operations, fast Hamming-distance LUTs, and optional KAN-HD compression. This lifts REV from brittle, hand-crafted probes to a \*\*high-dimensional semantic space\*\* where model similarity is measured as \*\*behavioral proximity\*\*, not merely output token equality. This HDC extension preserves privacy (hypervectors are distributed/obfuscated) and supports zero-knowledge-friendly verification.

\---

\#\# 1\. Motivation & Goals

State-of-practice LLM evaluation focuses on end-to-end behavior and accepts large memory footprints. REV addresses three gaps:

1\. \*\*Memory-bounded verification:\*\* Stream inference through segments to compare models larger than RAM/VRAM.   
2\. \*\*Modular equivalence:\*\* Evaluate \*\*where\*\* two models agree or diverge, instead of only whether final outputs match.   
3\. \*\*Auditability & tamper-resistance:\*\* Produce cryptographic commitments and a reproducible transcript compatible with Proof-of-Tests (PoT) workflows.

\*\*GenomeVault adaptation (new).\*\* Replace brittle probe families with \*\*semantic hypervectors\*\* that encode challenge features and model responses. This allows \*\*black-box\*\* behavioral sites that are robust, scalable, and privacy-preserving.

\*\*Threat model.\*\* We assume black-box or gray-box access to model inference with potential adversarial control over the runtime (e.g., model-switching or wrapper orchestration). REV detects inconsistencies at the segment level and within the HDC semantic layer, making stitching/spoofing attacks difficult. Optional attestation or zk proofs (outside REV’s core) can bind execution to hardware or circuits.

\*\*Non-goals.\*\* REV is \*\*not\*\* a weight-identity proof and does not guarantee bitwise equality of internal states. It tests \*\*behavioral equivalence\*\* of segments (architectural) and sites (semantic HDC) under a fixed policy and challenge distribution.

\#\# 2\. Background

\#\#\# 2.1 Transformer modularity and natural cut points  
Transformers exhibit recurring circuit motifs (e.g., induction heads, successor heads), MLP-mediated associative memories, and emergent modularity. Natural cut points align with boundaries \*\*within\*\* blocks (after attention, after MLP) and \*\*across\*\* blocks (end-of-block residual). REV exploits these boundaries for segmenting execution.

\#\#\# 2.2 Memory-bounded inference  
Modern serving systems reduce memory via paging/offload, activation checkpointing, and quantization. REV leverages these techniques but constrains the executor to a \*\*single-segment working set\*\*, ensuring applicability to models larger than device memory.

\#\#\# 2.3 Sketching and commitments  
REV separates \*\*similarity\*\* from \*\*integrity\*\*:   
\- \*\*Similarity sketches\*\*: low-precision, locality-sensitive projections of activations/logits that are robust to benign numeric drift.   
\- \*\*Cryptographic commitments\*\*: collision-resistant hashes of sketches/metadata in a Merkle tree per challenge for auditability.

\#\#\# 2.4 Sequential (anytime-valid) decisions  
Instead of fixed-sample tests, REV uses sequential tests (as in PoT) that control type-I/II errors while allowing early stopping. Per-challenge equality and distances aggregate into a stopping rule with explicit error guarantees.

\---

\#\# 3\. Problem Statement

\*\*Input:\*\* Two LLM oracles \\(M\_A, M\_B\\); a segmentation policy \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) yielding cut sites \\(s\_1, \\dots, s\_K\\); a public, pre-committed challenge generator \\(\\mathcal{C}\\); an execution policy \\(\\pi\\) (temperature, max tokens, decoding, precision, seeds); an HDC embedding policy \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) (dims, binding ops, zoom levels).

\*\*Output:\*\* Decision in {SAME, DIFFERENT, UNDECIDED} and a localization report identifying segments of first divergence \*\*and\*\* HDC behavioral neighborhoods where models differ.

\*\*Constraints:\*\* Peak memory \\(\\leq\\) bound; identical policies for A and B; deterministic or controlled-stochastic decoding; stable seeds and rounding.

\---

\#\# 4\. REV Design

\#\#\# 4.1 Restriction-site policies (architectural vs behavioral)  
\- \*\*Architectural sites (white/gray-box):\*\* After attention, after MLP, end-of-block, and block windows (e.g., layers 1–8, 5–12, 9–16) for overlap.   
\- \*\*Behavioral sites (HDC-based; black-box-friendly):\*\* Sites defined by \*\*semantic hypervectors\*\* derived from challenge features and response distributions. A site is a \*\*point (or tile) in HDC space\*\*; matching means hypervectors are within a distance threshold.

\*\*Overlap windows.\*\* To resist stitching attacks, architectural segments are evaluated with overlapping windows (\\(\[1..8\], \[5..12\], \[9..16\],\\dots\\)). On the behavioral side, \*\*zoom levels\*\* (Section 6\) provide multi-resolution “overlap”.

\#\#\# 4.2 Challenge generation (PoT-aligned)  
\- \*\*Seeds:\*\* \\(\\text{seed}\_i \\leftarrow \\mathrm{HMAC}(\\text{key}, \\text{run\\\_id} \\parallel i)\\)   
\- \*\*Templates:\*\* Seeded grammars/datasets; include adversarial variants for robustness.   
\- \*\*Public transcript:\*\* Seeds, templates, decoding policy published before evaluation.

\#\#\# 4.3 Segment signatures (architectural path)  
For each challenge \\(c\\) and architectural segment \\(s\\): extract activations/logits, project & quantize to a \*\*sketch\*\* \\(\\sigma\_s\\), and hash to leaf \\(h\_s\\). Per-challenge Merkle root \\(H\_c\\) aggregates \\(\\{h\_s\\}\\).

\#\#\# 4.4 Streaming executor  
\- Load parameters for segment \\(s\\), run forward, emit \\(a\_s\\), release memory.   
\- Maintain KV cache per policy; support overlap via checkpointing or replay.   
\- Compatible with quantization/offload (8-bit/4-bit) with stable numerics.

\#\#\# 4.5 Decision layer (sequential)  
Per challenge \\(c\\), compute: (i) \*\*Merkle equality indicator\*\* \\(I\_c\\) and (ii) \*\*distance score\*\* \\(d\_c\\). Feed to an anytime-valid tester for SAME/DIFFERENT/UNDECIDED.

\#\# 6\. \*\*Semantic Hypervector Behavioral Sites (GenomeVault Adaptation)\*\*

We integrate \*\*GenomeVault’s Semantic Hypervector Architecture\*\* to define \*\*behavioral sites\*\* in a high-dimensional space. Instead of hand-crafted probe families, a prompt (challenge) and a model’s response are \*\*encoded into hypervectors\*\* using binding/permutation operations that preserve semantic structure and support privacy-preserving similarity.

\#\#\# 6.1 Core Concept: Beyond 1:1 Matching  
GenomeVault transforms structured inputs into high-dimensional vectors (8K–100K dims) that preserve semantic relationships while enabling privacy-preserving computation. REV adapts this to LLMs by embedding \*\*prompt features\*\* and \*\*response features\*\* into hypervectors, then computing \*\*Hamming/cosine distances\*\* as behavioral similarity.

\#\#\#\# (A) Semantic Embedding via Structural Encoding (genomics → LLMs)  
From GenomeVault’s genomic featurizer (illustrative excerpt):  
\`\`\`python  
\# genomevault/hypervector/featurizers/variants.py  
def variant\_to\_numeric(v: Dict) \-\> List\[float\]:  
   chrom \= float(CHROM\_MAP.get(str(v.get("chrom", "")), 0))  \# chrom context  
   pos   \= float(v.get("pos", 0)) % 1\_000\_000                \# position  
   ref   \= \_hash01(str(v.get("ref", "")))                    \# ref allele  
   alt   \= \_hash01(str(v.get("alt", "")))                    \# alt allele  
   impact \= IMPACT\_MAP.get(str(v.get("impact", "")), 0.0)    \# functional impact  
\`\`\`  
\*\*REV adaptation:\*\* Map a \*\*probe\*\* to a numeric feature tuple, e.g.:  
\- \`task\_category\` (classification, summarization, math\_reasoning)   
\- \`syntactic\_complexity\` (n-gram entropy, depth, dependency arcs)   
\- \`knowledge\_domain\` (finance, biology, law, …)   
\- \`reasoning\_depth\` (chain-of-thought proxies, steps budget)   
Hash or ordinal-encode these and \*\*bind\*\* them to build a \*\*probe hypervector\*\*.

\#\#\#\# (B) Multi-Modal Binding Operations  
From GenomeVault’s binding ops (illustrative excerpt):  
\`\`\`python  
\# genomevault/hypervector\_transform/binding.py  
class BindingType(Enum):  
   MULTIPLY   \= "multiply"      \# element-wise relationships  
   CIRCULAR   \= "circular"      \# circular convolution for sequences  
   PERMUTATION= "permutation"   \# positional encoding  
   XOR        \= "xor"           \# binary logical relationships  
   FOURIER    \= "fourier"       \# frequency-domain binding  
\`\`\`  
\*\*REV adaptation:\*\* Bind \*\*feature sub-vectors\*\* (task, syntax, domain, length scales) via XOR/permutation/circular-convolution to construct robust \*\*probe hypervectors\*\*; encode \*\*response logit profiles\*\* similarly into \*\*response hypervectors\*\*.

\#\#\#\# (C) Hamming Distance LUT Acceleration  
GenomeVault’s LUT-based popcount (illustrative excerpt):  
\`\`\`python  
\# genomevault/hypervector/operations/hamming\_lut.py  
def hamming\_distance\_cpu(vec1, vec2, lut=None):  
   \# Process 64-bit words as four 16-bit lookups  
   distance \+= POP16\[(xor\_val \>\> 0\)  & 0xFFFF\]  
   distance \+= POP16\[(xor\_val \>\> 16\) & 0xFFFF\]  
   distance \+= POP16\[(xor\_val \>\> 32\) & 0xFFFF\]  
   distance \+= POP16\[(xor\_val \>\> 48\) & 0xFFFF\]  
\`\`\`  
\*\*REV adaptation:\*\* Use \*\*bit-packed hypervectors\*\* and 16-bit LUTs for \*\*10–20× speed\*\* vs naive popcount, enabling \*\*real-time\*\* per-challenge comparisons across thousands of sites.

\#\#\#\# (D) Spoof-Resistant Properties  
\- \*\*Distributed representation:\*\* No single dimension reveals content; adversaries can’t trivially spoof specific bits.   
\- \*\*Hash-based encoding:\*\* e.g., \`\_hash01\` via BLAKE2b for stable, non-invertible feature encoding:  
\`\`\`python  
def \_hash01(s: str) \-\> float:  
   h \= hashlib.blake2b(s.encode("utf-8"), digest\_size=8).digest()  
   return int.from\_bytes(h, "little") / (2\*\*64 \- 1\)  
\`\`\`  
\- \*\*Dimensional obfuscation:\*\* High-dimensional space thwarts reverse-engineering; good for privacy-preserving evaluation.

\#\#\# 6.2 Advanced Similarity: Hierarchical Zoom, ECC, KAN-HD  
\- \*\*Hierarchical Zoom:\*\* Maintain hypervectors at multiple scales (e.g., prompt-level, span-level, token-window-level). Example registry:  
\`\`\`python  
zoom\_levels \= {  
   0: {},  \# corpus/site-wide prototypes  
   1: {},  \# prompt-level hypervectors  
   2: {},  \# span/tile-level hypervectors  
}  
\`\`\`  
\- \*\*Error-Correcting Codes:\*\* Add XOR parity blocks (25% storage) to reduce false divergences by \~30% under numeric noise/quantization.  
\- \*\*KAN-HD Hybrid:\*\* Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks compress or denoise hypervectors (50–100×) while preserving interpretability for regulatory/compliance contexts.

\#\#\# 6.3 Computational Efficiency (illustrative)  
| Operation                          | Traditional | HDC (GenomeVault) | HDC+KAN-HD | Speedup (vs Trad.) |  
|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|--------------------|  
| Similarity Search (1M sites)      | 10–30 s     | 10–50 ms          | 2–10 ms    | \~1,500–3,000×      |  
| Hamming Distance (10K-D vector)   | 50–100 µs   | 20–40 µs          | 5–10 µs    | \~10–20×            |  
| Privacy-Preserving Query          | N/A         | 50–200 ms         | 20–100 ms  | ∞                  |

\*Notes:\* Table is indicative; actual performance depends on hardware (CPU SIMD, PULP/FPGA), vector width, and LUT implementation.

\#\#\# 6.4 Privacy-Preserving Comparison  
\- \*\*Homomorphic-friendly ops:\*\* Similarity computations on encoded hypervectors without plaintext responses.   
\- \*\*Federated evaluation:\*\* Multi-party comparison without sharing raw prompts/responses.   
\- \*\*ZK-friendly commitments:\*\* Commit to hypervectors and distances, enabling zk proofs of behavioral closeness without revealing content.

\#\#\# 6.5 Behavioral Intelligence (LLM analogs)  
\- \*\*Task/Domain neighborhoods:\*\* Prompts in similar domains cluster; so do model responses with similar competencies.   
\- \*\*Reasoning pathways:\*\* Multi-step reasoning leaves consistent “signatures” in response hypervectors.   
\- \*\*Population structure analogy:\*\* Fine-tuned families (e.g., instruction-tuned, safety-tuned) occupy nearby regions—useful for \*\*relationship inference\*\* (“distilled-from”, “same-arch-different-scale”).

\- \*\*In the decision stream:\*\* Use \*\*HDC distances\*\* as \`d\_c\` and combine with architectural segment indicators in the sequential test.

\---

\#\# 8\. Engineering Considerations (updated)

\- \*\*Determinism:\*\* Fix decoding (temperature=0), seeds, math modes; record versions. HDC absorbs small numeric drift.   
\- \*\*Vector width:\*\* 8K–32K bits is a good starting range; scale with task diversity.   
\- \*\*LUT popcount:\*\* Precompute 16-bit POP tables; use SIMD for 64/128-bit lanes.   
\- \*\*ECC:\*\* Parity every 3–4 blocks; correct single-block flips per tile.   
\- \*\*KAN-HD:\*\* Optional; use for storage-restricted settings or to produce interpretable “axes” (spline factors).   
\- \*\*Black-box APIs:\*\* If only final tokens/logprobs are available, build response hypervectors from \*\*logit slices\*\* and output tokens; still robust.   
\- \*\*Interoperability:\*\* Ensure domain separation for all seeds (\`run\_id || seg\_id || site\_id || version\`).

\---

\#\# 9\. Validity & Limitations

\*\*Assertions.\*\* Under a fixed execution and HDC policy, two models that consistently match architectural segment sketches \*\*and\*\* exhibit small HDC distances across behavioral sites are \*\*behaviorally equivalent\*\* in both localized computation and semantic output space.

\*\*Non-assertions.\*\* Weight equality; equivalence under shifted policies; robustness to fully adaptive attackers with oracle access to both models during evaluation (mitigate via pre-commitment, rate limits, timing jitter, overlap/zoom redundancy).

\*\*Failure modes.\*\* Poor feature taxonomy; too-narrow vector width; adversarial response shaping (mitigated by zoom levels, ECC, multi-head binding, and Merkle commitments).

\---

\#\# 10\. Evaluation Plan (updated)

1\. \*\*Sanity:\*\* A vs A; A vs quantized(A); A vs distilled(A); A vs B (different family).   
2\. \*\*Ablations:\*\* Vector width; binding ops; top-K size; zoom levels; ECC on/off; KAN-HD on/off.   
3\. \*\*Localization:\*\* Inject edits in specific blocks (architectural) and specific domains (behavioral prompts) and confirm earliest divergence.   
4\. \*\*Operating characteristics:\*\* FAR/FRR vs challenges; stopping time distributions; robustness under kernel nondeterminism.   
5\. \*\*Privacy:\*\* Measure information leakage from hypervectors; verify Merkle/zk auditability.

\---

\#\# 11\. Security & Integrity Extensions

\- \*\*TEE/Attestation:\*\* Bind executor to hardware with code+weights attestations.   
\- \*\*zkML:\*\* Prove distance computations over committed hypervectors on sampled challenges.   
\- \*\*Watermarks:\*\* Complementary signals to assert provenance or detect wrapper orchestration.

\#\# 13\. Practical Recipe (TL;DR)

1\. Choose \*\*architectural segments\*\* and \*\*HDC behavioral sites\*\*.   
2\. Pre-commit challenges with HMAC; publish policies and HDC seeds.   
3\. Stream each model segment-by-segment; at each site produce \*\*(i)\*\* segment sketch and \*\*(ii)\*\* HDC response hypervector sketch; commit both to a Merkle tree.   
4\. Compare per-challenge Merkle roots; compute \*\*segment\*\* and \*\*HDC\*\* distances.   
5\. Run an anytime-valid sequential test until SAME/DIFFERENT.   
6\. Publish the transcript (seeds, policies, roots, first-divergence reports, HDC summaries) and resource profile.

\#\#\# Acknowledgments  
This document integrates the \*\*GenomeVault semantic hypervector architecture\*\* (HDC encoding, binding ops, LUT acceleration, ECC, KAN-HD, privacy mechanisms) into the REV framework for memory-bounded, black-box LLM verification. It synthesizes prior art in transformer interpretability, vector-symbolic/HDC computation, authenticated data structures, and anytime-valid statistics to provide a robust, auditable, and privacy-preserving behavioral comparison protocol.
